# Arman Fidanoglu Personal Website
This website was built with React, using libraries such as Material UI and more. The swipe-based navigation system was designed and built from scratch to be intuitive, using SwipeJS as a starting point. Building this navigation system was difficult, but proved to be a great exercise. TypeScript was chosen over JavaScript due to being strongly typed and more robust.

## Mobile-first design
The website will appear entirely differently if viewed on a mobile device, as it was built to be touch-friendly and intuitive when used on a mobile phone. Just swipe in any direction to see different sections!
